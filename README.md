# Windows 10 HTML Replica

## Note
_This replica is very much a work in progress. Currently many core features are missing_

# Features

  - Minimize, maximize, close windows

  ### Start Menu
  - (non-mobile) Rearrange start menu apps

  ## Built-in 'Apps'
  ### Edge browser 
  - Navigate to any website that supports iframes

  ### Settings
  - Personalize the background of your desktop using either your own background URL
    or one of the preset backgrounds

  ### SpotiFree
  - Play tunes from one of the other websites I built

  ### File Explorer
  - Absolutely useless, but what is windows without Explorer?

  _I'll add things to this project as I think of things for it. Feel free to give me some ideas!_
